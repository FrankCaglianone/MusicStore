# MusicStore üéµ
A dynamic music store application for efficiently organizing and retrieving music collections based on artists, albums, and songs.

## Project Purpose üéØ
The purpose of **MusicStore** is to provide a structured and efficient solution for managing and querying music collections. It reads and categorizes music files based on artist, album, and track details, enabling streamlined access to your favorite music. The project is designed to support large collections and ensure efficient querying, making it suitable for music enthusiasts and digital archivists.

## Important Features ‚ú®
- **Music Organization**: Automatically categorizes music files based on the artist, album, and track information extracted from file names.
- **Efficient Query System**: Retrieve specific artists, albums, or songs with callback-based query functions.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Recognizes and processes popular audio file formats, including `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.wma`, and `.mpc`.
- **Scalable Structure**: Efficient handling of large collections with sublinear query complexity.
- **Extensible Callbacks**: Flexibility to define custom callback functions to handle query results.

   - `-<index>`: Destroys the musicstore object at the specified index.
   - `=<index>`: Switches to the musicstore object at the specified index.
   - `artist`: <name>: Sets the artist filter to the specified name.
   - `album`: <name>: Sets the album filter to the specified name.
   - `title`: <name>: Sets the title filter to the specified name.
   - `read <directory>`: Reads the specified directory and stores the music data in the current musicstore.
   - `get_songs`: Prints all songs matching the current artist, album, and title filters.
